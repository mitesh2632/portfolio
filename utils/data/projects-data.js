      "This personalized AI solution enables users to create their own digital replica using their face, voice, and personality traits. The platform begins with a user onboarding process that collects basic information and personality-based questionnaire responses, allowing users to define interests through predefined or custom prompts. To generate a digital persona, users upload or record a video, which is processed via Tavus.io to create a unique Persona ID. Once created, users can interact with their AI-powered persona through a dashboard and invite others to engage with it. The system supports different roles: regular users who complete onboarding and manage their personas and minutes, and invited users who can interact with shared personas but must subscribe to create their own. A monthly subscription, managed through Stripe, is required to upload videos, and each user receives 20 free minutes with the option to purchase more. Users can also share their persona and allocate minutes to others for collaborative engagement",
